# IDS Workshop 2024 "Interactive Maps with Leaflet"
### üëã by Elena Murray and Franco Bastida!


## Summary

Hello there! If you came looking for Leaflet resources, this is your place! 

These materials will teach you the basics to create interactive maps with Leaflet.

The repository is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in October 2024. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24) taught by Prof. Dr. Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2024.

## Session Contents

The contents of this session will introduce Leaflet as a data visualization tool that can help you identify patterns, trends, and relationships that may not be obvious in raw data. This can add value to your toolbox as a data scientist or practitioner supporting policymakers and other stakeholders. 

*Remember, a map is worth a thousand words!*


## Main Learning Objectives

The goals of this session are to:
1. equip you with conceptual knowledge to use the Leaflet package and integrate your own data sets;
2. show you some key functions of the package to add markers, polygons, and other interesting layers; and
3. provide you with concrete examples through a tutorial as well as additional resources. 


## Tutorial

The session is accompanied by a tutorial, which can be accessed [here](x).
